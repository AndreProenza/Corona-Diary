        onset of the pandemic. The country has a total of 20,863 cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection,

        were released this Monday in the epidemiological bulletin of the Directorate-General for Health (DGS).</p>
      <p>The fatality rate in Portugal is 3.5%, and over 70 years old is 12.8%. The number of retrieved
        remains unchanged: there are 610 — to be considered "cured", two negative tests are needed.</p>
      <p>There are 1208 in-patients and 215 in intensive care units (nine fewer than on Sunday).
        People undergoing treatment at home account for 87.8% of cases. The percentage in hospital is 5.8%,
        with 1.8% in intensive care and 4.8% in the infirmary”, revealed the Secretary of State for Health,
        António Lacerda Sales, at a press conference.</p>

      immune to the virus, maintain the care from before. Most say they are still isolated at home.</h3>
    <p> Manuel is a nurse and volunteered to start working with those infected,
      but he takes no more risks and continues to sleep in a different room from his wife and stay away from his daughters.</p>
    <p> Sílvia no longer spends her life cleaning the house with water and bleach but she still doesn't dare to join the rest
      of the extended family — not even with those who have also been infected and have already been reported as recovered.</p>
    <p> And if Sara has finally allowed herself to play with her 2-and-a-half-year-old son, without wearing a mask, on the other hand
      side doesn't even want to hear about stepping back into the street — which is not without its fair share of irony,
      since it was precisely at home that she caught the new coronavirus.</p>
    <p> All had Covid-19 and all were reported as recovered — they are part of the only green-hope value that
      it appears in the reports where the General Directorate of Health reports on the evolution of the disease, exactly that
      which rises more slowly and continues, at least for the time being, not being able to surpass the black number of deaths.</p>
