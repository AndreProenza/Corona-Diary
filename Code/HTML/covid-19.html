				<h2>Symptoms</h2>

				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>				
				<p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and will recover without the need for special treatment. Elderly people and those with medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.</p>
				<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infections by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based mop often and without touching your face.</p>
				<p>The COVID-19 virus is mainly spread by droplets of saliva or nasal secretions when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it is important that you practice breathing etiquette (coughing into the bent elbow).</p>
				<p>At the moment, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. But, there are many clinical trials going on evaluating possible treatments.</p>
